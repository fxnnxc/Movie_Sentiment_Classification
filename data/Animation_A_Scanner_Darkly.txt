   The sound of fingers scratching scalp begins and grows louder
   through the following montage.

   A massive, unlit Coca-Cola sign is eerily silhouetted
   against the early morning sky. Antiquated delivery trucks
   set out from loading docks, as red futuristic cargo planes,
   emblazoned with the Coca-Cola logo, take off from the roof.

A Coca-Cola truck rumbles slowly past a row of low-income,
plastic pre-fab houses. We hold on one house whose front
lawn is strewn with furniture and cleaning products.

The windows are spray-painted over with silver paint. A

the room, which is emptied of furniture, covered in a sickly
green shag carpet, and littered with fast-food wrappers. In

the center of the room stands Jerry Fabin, thirty, with wild-
eyes and a long, tangled mass of hair. He is naked, draped
over a metal garbage can, and vigorously scratching his
head. This process continues for an uncomfortably long
time. A Golden Retriever sleeps in the corner.

<b>INT. JERRY FABIN'S BATHROOM - LATER

Jerry Fabin stands under a hot shower. Steam fills the
stall. He scrubs his hair violently with tensed fingers.

We hear the shower. Steam pours out the open bathroom door.

<b>EXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - MID-DAY

The sun is high; the day is bright and hazy.   A few hippies
stroll by or sit on front steps, discreetly smoking joints.
We hear the distant sound of Jerry's shower.

Jerry is still in the shower, scrubbing away. He finally
turns it off and steps out, a drowned rat. He dries
himself, wipes the mirror and squints nervously at his
reflection. Tiny bugs hop around on his head. He screams.

<b>INT. JERRY FABIN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER
</b>
Jerry lies on the cruddy shag carpet, open volumes of the
Encyclopedia Brittanica spread around him. He scratches
himself as he studies one of the volumes. Insects hop up and
down all over his body, and on the rug. When he exhales, a
cloud of bugs pours from his mouth; he shoos them away.

<b>EXT. JERRY FABIN'S HOUSE - DAY
</b>
Jerry heads up the walkway carrying a shopping bag. Several
cans of Raid and other bug sprays poke out of the bag. Bugs
hop around on Jerry. He puts the bag down on the stoop to
scratch himself. He notices tiny bugs chewing the shrubs.

<b>INT. NURSERY - DAY

Jerry consults with a man behind the cash register.

Fabin just stares at the clerk.

Scrawled charts depicting the aphid life-cycle now adorn the
walls. As Jerry sprays a can of "Aphid-Off" around the
room, he notices his sleeping dog is covered with the bugs.

Jerry stands in the shower with his dog. Jerry is lathered
head-to-toe and in the process of lathering the dog.

Jerry and the long-suffering dog are still in the shower.
Charles Freck, early thirties and stoned, enters.

Jerry turns off the shower, steps out with the dog, and
begins drying him. Freck watches silently, transfixed, as
Jerry proceeds to rub oil, then talc into the dog's coat.

Jerry stops talcing the dog, looks up at Freck.

Jerry and Freck are on all fours on the carpet. Bugs hop
all around. The powdered-white dog sleeps in the corner.

Jerry grabs a bug from the carpet, throws it in a jar, and
clamps the lid down fast. He shows it triumphantly to Freck.

scratching himself again, trying not to be too obvious.

</b>          Hey, man, you continue while I take a

Jerry heads to the bathroom. The dog, who has been sleeping
near the bathroom door, skulks to the other side of the room.

</b>          Jerry, these bugs sort of scare me.    I

himself vigorously. Freck is barely audible throughout.

ritualistically, totally absorbed in his task.

<b>INT. LION'S CLUB HALL - DAY

We hear pronounced, rhythmic breathing, as we scan the hall,
which is filled with middle-aged businessmen wearing an
array of brightly colored suits. They are well-fed and dull-
looking. At the podium is another bussinessman, this one fat
in a pink suit and yellow tie. He addresses the assemblage.

<b>                       FAT BUSINESSMAN

          opportunity this afternoon. The
          county of Orange has provided us with
          the chance to hear from -- and put
          questions to -- an undercover
          narcotics agent from the Sheriff's
          Office.

The fat businessman gestures with a sweep of his arm toward
the camera.

The heavy breathing stops as we angle on what the fat
businessman is gesturing toward: a generic blur of a human
being sitting on stage. The blur is clearly human, but it's
impossible to settle on its facial features. It's as if the
features keep changing.

<b>                       FAT BUSINESSMAN (CONT'D)
</b>          Now you will notice that you can
          barely see this individual becuase he
          is wearing what is called a "scramble
          suit", which he wears during most of
          his daily activities of law
          enforcement. Due to potential
          corruption within the Sheriff's
          Department, even this gallant
          officer's co-workers and superiors
          must not know his "street" identity.

Heavy breathing. Again we're inside the suit. Now we see,
in shadowy profile, the face of the man in the suit. This is
Bob Arctor, early thirties, homely, and looking like a
druggie. He scans the audience disdainfully.

          thousands of different human faces
          onto your retinas, thus turning Fred
          into a veritable Everyman. All things
          to all people translates into nothing
          to anyone, does it not?

The fat businessman smiles a big, toothy smile.   The audience
of straights smiles back, almost in unison.

The audience erupts into enthusiastic applause. Fred rises
and replaces the fat businessman behind the podium. When he
speaks it is an emotionless computer voice.

          say, "There goes a weirdo freak
          doper." And you'd feel aversion and
          walk away.

The audience is silent, blank, their blankness a reflection
of the blankness of Fred's scramble suit.

Freck drives slowly along a strip-malled Anaheim street. He
passes a Thrifty pharmacy and notices the window display:
bottles of slow death, slow death mixed with speed and junk
and psychedelics. Dayglow signs in the window: "Your
Credit is Good Here" and "Death to the Masses" He looks
again. The window displays combs and shampoo. Freck checks
his rearview mirror, sees a police car following him.

          I doing? Was I weaving? I don't even
          know.

Freck drives very deliberately, his hands gripped, white-
knuckled, on the steering wheel in an attempt to keep the car
completely straight. He tries his best to plaster a non-
stoned, regular guy look on his face. But he's sweating.

druggie, wanders depressed and aimless along a crowded
street. He passes a McDonald's, a 7-11, a mirrored office
building, pulls a pill box from his pocket, and
surreptitiously swallows two capsules. He studies his
reflection in the office building. Behind him on the street
are the disapproving reflections of passing straights. He
blends back into the flow of foot traffic. A grungy hippy

five, ninety, one hundred. Arctor reaches down, tries to
fiddle with the gas peddle. The car is rocketing right for
a VW van chugging along. Barris and Luckman throw up their
hands. Arctor swerves to the left of the van at the last
minute. They pass it, but a fast moving Corvette had been
about to pass in that lane. It honks, its brakes screech.

Barris smiles, puts it away. Arctor tries to focus back on
the engine. He sways lightheadedly and supports himself
against the car. The hot sun beats down on the back of his
head. Cars whiz by, the traffic noises intensified. He
hears singing, quiet at first, but soon overwhelming. It's

silhouetted against the sun. Luckman says something, but
Arctor can't make it out over the singing and the traffic

watches, paralyzed. Barris casually rises and strolls into
the kitchen. He studies Luckman spread out on the floor.
He looks at the dishes and pots scattered about. Then,
suddenly, he rips off his sunglasses in a faux panic,
working himself up for the frantic 911 phone call. His eyes
widen in horror, he flaps his arms helplessly, runs back and

Donna walks over to him, puffing the hash pipe to keep it
alive. She bends over him and Arctor opens his mouth. She
exhales long and forcefully into his mouth. This is as close

up at Donna.

Arctor enters the dimly lit bedroom followed by Connie, a
skinny girl with hollow eyes and a flat affect. He sifts
through his dresser drawer as she hovers behind him. Finally
he pulls out a baggie with some pills in it. Throughout, we
hear stoned conversation coming from another room.

Connie stuffs the baggie into her purse. She sits on the
bed and begins to unceremoniously undress. When her blouse
comes off, we see needle tracks and bruises on her arms.
She pulls a comb from her purse and listlessly combs her
lank hair. She drops the hand holding the comb and begins
to nod. Arctor looks at the tracks, at the pimple on her
cheek. Connie wakes up, sort of, and starts combing again.

bolts upright, studies her face. It's still Donna. He
fumbles for the switch on the night table lamp and knocks it
to the floor. The woman next to him sleeps on. He watches
her face. Gradually it begins to turn back into Connie.
Arctor drops onto his back and looks at the ceiling.

Fred sits in his cubicle monitoring the scanners. On one
scanner Barris sits in the living room reading a book about
mushrooms. After a moment, he lays the book face down on the
coffee table and leaves the house. Fred watches the empty
living room. He presses the fast forward button. The
sunlight coming in through the living room window shifts as
the day speeds by. The living room door opens. Fred slows
the tape to normal speed. Barris is back at the couch with
a brown bag. He dumps several mushrooms onto the table,
compares them with illustrations in the book. Finally, he
puts one aside, throws the rest in the bag, crumbles the
mushroom, and fills capsules. He dials the phone. An LED on

Fred watches the monitors. Arctor's house is quiet. Barris
and Luckman doze in the living room, the television tuned to
static. On another monitor, Arctor is sleeping in his bed
with a woman. After a beat Fred notices the woman is Donna.
We move in close to Fred's ever-changing eyes.

Fred fast-rewinds the tape, switches it to play. Arctor is
in bed having sex with Connie. Fred sighs a computerized
sigh of relief and fast-forwards the tape. Arctor is now
sleeping next to Connie. Fred watches for a moment. As he
does the face of the sleeping woman transforms into Donna's.
Fred freezes the frame. Then he enlarges the holographic
image so it fills up the space previously occupied by all
eight monitors. The image is now almost actual size. Fred
rises and walks around the console into the projection area.
It's as if he's entering Arctor's bedroom, or a slightly
scaled down, frozen version of it. He approaches the
sleeping couple, bends down and examines the face of the
woman. It is clearly Donna. He stands in Arctor's bedroom
for a while, confused and disoriented, tries to look at
himself in Arctor's bureau mirror. Fred does not appear in
the holographic reflection of the room. He shudders,
returns to the console, brings up all eight monitors, and
turns off the freeze-frame. On the bedroom monitor, Arctor
awakens, and glances over at the woman sleeping next to him.
His eyes widen. He fumbles for the switch on the bedside
lamp, knocks it over. He turns back and stares at the
sleeping woman. As does Fred at the console.

shelf, and places it face down and open on his bed.

<b>INT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY

Fred sits in his scramble suit watching a holo-tape. In it
Arctor is pulling a book from the shelf in his living room
and opening it. Fred zooms in to the title of the book. It
is The Picture Book of Sexual Love. Fred zooms back out to
take in the entire scene. Arctor recites, ostensibly from
the book, in a creaky, stagy way.

his floor, a bag of reds by his side.

Fred rises and paces in front of the console, keeping an eye
on the monitors, trying to figure what Arctor is up to. On
the other monitor, we see that Arctor's recitation has
roused Luckman, who sits up groggily and listens to the odd
German-English rant. Luckman picks up an axe, heads to the
bedroom door, and listens there intently. In the living
room, Arctor has put down his book and is sifting through
the pile of mail on the coffee table. He tosses a large
piece of junk mail at the trash can. It misses and crashes
against the wall. In his bedroom, Luckman hears the crash.
He stiffens suspiciously, sniffs the air, raises the axe,
ready to tear into the other room and attack. In the living
room, Arctor reads a piece of mail.

Fred sighs, fast-forwards the tape. He watches on the meter
until an hour's worth of tape has passed. He switches back
to play. Arctor is across the room now, sprinkling food
into a fish tank. Luckman is stretched out on the couch.

<b>EXT. BOB ARCTOR'S FRONT YARD - DAY
</b>
Arctor is finishing up mowing the lawn. He is intently
focused on the task, but has done an erratic job: the left
side of the yard has been left almost completely unmowed.
Arctor turns to enter the house. We see that the left side
of his face is completely unshaved.

<b>INT. ROOM 203 - DAY
</b>
Fred is in the midst of a battery of tests being
administered by two uniformed medical technicians who
resemble the technicians who administered the previous
tests, but are not the same. Fred's head rests in a
contraption that divides his face in half, so his right eye
and left eye can be exposed to different projected images.

<b>                       MEDICAL TECHNICIAN #3
</b>          Okay, Fred, in rapid succession you
          will see a number of objects pass
          before first you left eye, then your
          right eye. At the same time, on the
          panel before you, outlines of these
          objects will appear. You are to
          match, by means of the punch pencil
          you hold in your hand, the outline
          with the object. These images will
          flash very quickly so don't hesitate
          too long. You will be scored for time
          as well as accuracy. Okay?

Technician #4 flips a lever, the panel in front of Fred
lights up, and we see a wide array of outline drawings: a
hammer, a shoe, a seagull, a camel, etc. Then in rapid
succession, photographic images of these objects and others
flash before Fred's left eye. He tries to keep up.

Fred, now with an eye patch over his left eye, faces a
screen. On the table in front of him is a wide array of
small objects: A toy boat, a die, a key, a marble, etc.

</b>          Next, you will reach into this box and
          touch the object inside with your left
          hand. After that you will be shown
          three objects visually. They will
          somewhat resemble each other and you
          will tell us which one most resembles
          the item you felt in the box.

Fred sits with a pile of oddly shaped blocks, which he is
attempting to fit into their corresponding holes.

          show me your identification, please?

Donna lays Arctor gently on the ground. She approaches the
cop, signals him away from the unconscious Arctor, and hands
him her wallet. He studies it in his flashlight beam.

Arctor lies on the floor, curled up and shivering. Dried
vomit flecks his face. The stain on his pants is bigger
now. Two New-Path staff members stand surveying the
trembling Arctor. Donna kneels at his side.

<b>INT. DONNA'S CAR - NIGHT
</b>
Donna drives her tiny MG on the freeway in heavy traffic
behind a huge Coca Cola truck. She picks a tape from the
show box in the back. It's Carole King's Tapestry. She
plugs it in and cranks it up loud, then pulls a pistol out
from under the dashboard. She unrolls the window, sticks
the pistol out, and begins firing at the Coke truck. She
hits it several times before the clip is emptied. Broken
Coke bottle glasses and brown liquid splatter her windshield.
This soothes her for a moment, but misery builds up in her
again almost instantly. To relieve it, she floors it and
smashes into the truck with all her might. The impact spins
the MG around. Tires shriek against fender as her car comes
to rest on the shoulder facing against traffic. Water pours
from her radiator. Her headlights dim. Donna gets out of
the car and looks at the Coke truck. It is still grinding
along, seemingly untouched. Motorists gape at Donna as they
crawl by. One guy unrolls his window.

Arctor sits with a paper cup of coffee. There are others in
the lounge, but they pay him no attention. He stares down
at his coffee, focused on the rising and swirling steam.

<b>INT. MEETING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</b>
Arctor sits on a folding chair in a semi-circle of residents
and a staff member. He stares down at his hands. A
portable blackboard is covered with scribbled words, such as
"Goals", "Responsibility", and "Community." A large coffee
urn percolates in the corner, making a "whoop-whoop" sound.
Arctor focuses on this sound, which frightens him.

          alive. A meditating monk is not dead.

The room is filled with sad-looking people at collapsible
tables eating dinner off trays. Arctor sits at a table by
himself, and stares down at his steaming soup.

A bunch of residents excitedly rifle through a cardboard box
of donated clothing. Arctor stands back from the box and
look at his feet. Mike, a short, stocky man with a pug face
slips into a shirt that looks like an American flag.

kids laughing in background.    We scan the following words,
read offhandedly by Arctor.

</b>          For now we see through a glass,
          darkly; but then face to face: now I
          know in part...

The camera pulls back to reveal that it's Donna reading the
journal. She's sitting at a picnic table outside a
McDonald's. Her eyes move back and forth across the page.
Near her, a group of children laugh and play on a
McDonaldland jungle gym.

</b>          ...but then shall I know even as also
          I am known.

That's the last entry. She closes the notebook, takes a sip
of Coke, and watches the children play. A pick-up truck
pulls into the parking lot. Mike gets out, approaches
Donna's table, sits across from her. There's a silence,
then:

             There's really nothing to suspect.
             They can't get anything out of him
             during the game sessions.

Donna looks off for a moment, sadly.

</b>             Well, then, will he be able to act,

             few charred brain cells flicker on.
             People like him are clacking insects.

Donna gets up and walks away.    Mike watches after her.

<b>INT. NEW-PATH HALLWAY - DAY
</b>
Arctor opens the door to the room where he first saw the
children. In there now is an old woman trying to juggle. She
smiles at Arctor and he sees that she has almost no teeth.

<b>                          OLD WOMAN
</b>             Can you do this?

She throws the balls in the air to juggle and they fall back
onto her then bounce onto the floor. She stoops over,
spitting and laughing. Arctor is dismayed.

Arctor is pulling some cleaning supplies from the cabinet
under the sink. He notices something, picks it up, studies
it. It's a bone fragment. He gets frightened, turns to
someone cutting vegetables, and holds up the bone.

<b>EXT. NAPA VALLEY FARM - DAY

It's a hot, bright day. A car drives in through the gate of
the razor-wire fenced farm, and raises dust as it heads
toward a cluster of wooden houses. It stops and Arctor
steps out, pulling a suitcase after him. He is met at the
car by the farm manager, a middle-aged man with a sun-
creased face. The car drives off.

<b>EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY
</b>
Arctor, in a cap and carrying a pesticide sprayer, wades
through the stalks, checking for insect infestation. His
entire focus, his entire consciousness is directed at this
task. His hat blows off, and he bends to pick it up. As he
nears the ground, he notices a second crop growing
underneath, hidden by the corn. It's a small, bright blue
flower, and now that he's close to the ground, he can see it
planted everywhere. He squats there, transfixed. Someone
comes up behind him. It's the Executive Director of New-
Path. Arctor doesn't look up; he just stares at the flowers.

Arctor keeps staring. The Executive Director reaches down
and holds his open hand in Arctor's field of vision. Arctor
doesn't move his head; he just continues to stare, now at the
Executive Director's hand.

          wouldn't comprehend. Epistemology --
          the theory of knowledge.

Arctor stares forever at the palm of the Executive
Director's rich, uncalloused hand, sees every crease.
Finally:

Now that the hand is gone, Arctor stares once again at the
blue flowers. The colors shift, grow more saturated.

inside his shoe. Shift back to normal speed and color.
