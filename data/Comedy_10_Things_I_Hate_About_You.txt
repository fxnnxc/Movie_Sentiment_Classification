</b><b>          PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban 
          high school in Portland, Oregon.  Smarties, Skids, Preppies, 
          Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep 
          out of their eyes and head for the main building.
<b>          
</b><b>          PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be 
          -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of 
          coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, 
          baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.
<b>          
</b>          A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and 
          spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.
<b>          
</b>          The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees 
          who his board has hit.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 RIDER
</b>                    Hey -- sorry.
<b>          
</b>          Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered 
          belongings.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 KAT
</b>                    Leave it 
<b>          
</b>          He persists.
<b>          
</b>                                 KAT (continuing)
                    I said, leave it!
<b>          
</b>          She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a 
          car, skateboard tip to his throat.  He whimpers pitifully 
          and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches 
          through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, 
          entering school.

</b><b>          INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the 
          mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but 
          still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.  
<b>

<b>          
</b>          Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway.
<b>          
</b><b>          HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
</b><b>          
</b>          Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both 
          boys
          and girls alike.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 BOY

</b><b>                                 GIRL
</b>                    Awesome shoes.
<b>          
</b>          The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and 
          unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, 
          acknowledging her fans.

</b><b>          GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</b><b>          
</b>          CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, 
          farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery 
          guidance counselor.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    I'm sure you won't find Padua any 
                    different than your old school.  Same 
                    little asswipe mother-fuckers 
                    everywhere.
<b>          
</b>          Her plastic smile never leaves her face.  Cameron fidgets in 
          his chair uncomfortably.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY

<b>          
</b><b>                                 CAMERON
</b>                    I don't think so, ma'am
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got 
                    deviants to see.
<b>          
</b>          Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK 
          VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms 
          Perky's door.  His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he 
          is.
<b>          
</b>          Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY

                    Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our 
                    visits a weekly ritual.
<b>          
</b>          She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming 
          smile.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 PATRICK
</b>                    I missed you.

</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    It says here you exposed yourself to a 
                    group of freshmen girls.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 PATRICK
</b>                    It was a bratwurst.  I was eating 
                    lunch.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    With the teeth of your zipper?
<b>          
</b>          She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron 
          shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, 
          brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game 
          show host.
<b>          
</b><b>                                 MICHAEL

                    tour.
